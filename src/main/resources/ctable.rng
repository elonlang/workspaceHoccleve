                In processing type elements, the first occurence of a type name should create
                a class (e.g., a Python class, or a class-object) for the type. Subsequent
                occurences of the type should be interpreted as references to the original
                type. A typeClass element, if it occurs with a previously defined type, should
                simply add to the typeClasses of that type.

                    <!--
                    The typeClass elements are related classes (defined elsewhere) of which
                    this type is a kind. For instance, if in an analysis of color, the
                    analyst identified "dark" and "red" as interesting types, but also noted
                    that "dark red", while having the qualities of the other two, was a thing
                    all its own, she might make a "dark-red" type with typeClass elements
                    "dark" and "red".

                    Following from the above example, if there weren't a need to distinguish
                    "dark-red", it would be better to specify "dark" and "red" types as two
                    type elements for the entries
