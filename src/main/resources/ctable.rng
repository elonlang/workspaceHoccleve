                    In processing type elements, the first occurence of a type name should create

                    occurences of the type should be interpreted as references to the original
                    type. A typeClass element, if it occurs with a previously defined type, should
                    simply add to the typeClasses of that type.

                        this type is a kind. For instance, if in an analysis of color, the
                        analyst identified "dark" and "red" as interesting types, but also noted
                        that "dark red", while having the qualities of the other two, was a thing
                        all its own, she might make a "dark-red" type with typeClass elements
                        "dark" and "red".

                        Following from the above example, if there weren't a need to distinguish
                        "dark-red", it would be better to specify "dark" and "red" types as two
                        type elements for the entries
